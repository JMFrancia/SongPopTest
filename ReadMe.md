- When initially designing this game I thought it made most sense to split it into three scenes (Title, Game, Results). Toward the end of the project I chose to have all scenes share some identical UI (background, blur effect). In retrospect, would have rather considered a different solution to keep the shared UI constant, either making everyone one scene or managing a persistent camera and canvas. Ultimately decided to just leave as is given scope of the assignment, but I wanted to let you know I'm aware it's not best practice.
